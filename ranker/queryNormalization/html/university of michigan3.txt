lsa opportunity hub
what will you do with your liberal arts degree?
the lsa opportunity hub can help you figure it out.
what the lsa opportunity hub does
1. coaching and preparation
we help you find ways to connect what you're learning inside the classroom with the possibilities that lie outside it. through one-on-one meetings, group workshops and applied liberal arts courses, we help you think through what you want to do and then we help you do it.
2. internships and experiences
we help you find internships and other outside-research assignments. we have more than 1,400 opportunities in the u.s. and around the world, in all kinds of sectors: business, education, finance, communication, arts, healthcare, technology, natural sciences, public policy, and more.
3. funding
we help you find the best possible internships for what you want to do and then help you afford it. everyone should have the same access to opportunities, so we can help cover the costs that come with an internship, like housing, airfare and food. up to $5,000 in support is available for each student who qualifies for the lsa internship scholarship. last year we awarded more than $1 million to help cover internship costs.
4. connections
we know people—employers, alumni and mentors in your field—and they want to meet you. as a u-m student you have access to one of the largest alumni networks in the world and people who are working in every field—tech, marketing, consulting, medicine and beyond. we help you expand your network and build real relationships within it.
