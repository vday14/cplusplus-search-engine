depending on the size of your spring form pan, you may need to make an extra 1/2 of the recipe (or at least of the crust).
sounds like fun!
happy thanksgiving.reply tarieka m. saysdecember 24, 2017 at 8:54 amso there is no bananas in the filling other than the sliced ones placed in the middle of the filling?reply lauren allen saysdecember 24, 2017 at 8:56 amyes, that’s right.reply charles mcclain jr saysdecember 25, 2017 at 11:49 pm an absolutely great banana pie recipe. i’ve made this several times in the last couple months for my elderly father whom i take care of. he says it’s quickly becoming his favorite over lemon meringue. however, i haven’t made him your version of lemon meringue. do you have one? i’ll sure give it a go. thanks so much, charles l. mcclain, jr.reply lauren allen saysdecember 27, 2017 at 8:40 pmthanks so much for sharing! i love hearing that your father loved it.
i am a huge lemon pie lover and have several lemon pie recipes, including lemon meringue! yum. here’s the link for the lemon meringue https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/lemon-meringue-pie/ (and you can use the search bar near the top of my website to search “lemon pie” if you’re interested in any of the other recipes. lemon sour cream is my favorite! https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/lemon-sour-cream-pie/reply michelle saysmarch 15, 2018 at 9:09 pm even reducing the sugar down 1/4 cup, it was still too sweet for me
also i’m thinking maybe the cooking time should have been increased because it tasted a little “powdery.”reply ashleigh saysmarch 15, 2018 at 11:53 pm i’ve always struggled with banana cream pie (when you cut it and remove a piece and the center collapses). i tried this recipe and it was exactly what i’ve always hoped for. held together. great flavor. my new go to recipe. thanks!reply cindy saysmarch 23, 2018 at 8:29 pmcan i make the custard the day before and then put it together?reply lauren allen saysapril 3, 2018 at 11:43 amhi cindy, the custard is best if it sets and cools inside the pie shell!reply liz saysapril 3, 2018 at 12:41 pm i love this pie recipe!
i am not even a big banana fan but my husband requested this pie for easter.
i made it and we all loved it!
followed the directions to a t and it turned out great.
i have tried your lemon sour cream pie and your triple berry pie and they are family favorites as well.
thanks so much!reply lacey melco saysapril 6, 2018 at 9:24 pm this is the best recipe i’ve found for banana cream pie. my whole family loved it!
this will be the only recipe for banana cream pie i will use from now on. thanks so much, lauren. beautifully worded instructions
made it very clear what to do.reply lauren allen saysapril 6, 2018 at 10:43 pmthank you so much lacey–what an amazing compliment! i’m so happy you loved it and thank you for taking the time to comment 🙂reply ray powell saysapril 7, 2018 at 5:44 pm what size pie plate do you use and how do you measure the size of the plate? outside bottom, inside bottom, inside top???thanks.reply lauren allen saysapril 10, 2018 at 12:44 pmmeasure pie plates from inside rim to inside rim.reply michelle saysapril 10, 2018 at 11:01 am i attempted this recipe this past weekend and after two tries i’m ready for a third. the fails were my fault, but i really thought the mixture was way too sweet.try #1: i failed at tempering the eggs and ended up with a yucky, eggy mess (though the filling set up nicely). i did notice that 1 1/4 cups of sugar made the filling way too sweet (i recommend cutting it down to a cup or even a little less) try #2: i was so concerned with tempering the eggs, i didn’t let the mixture set up long enough and ended up with delicious pudding, but not a good pie fillingi think if i cut the sugar back, let the mixture thicken up more and use even better vanilla (i used mccormick pure vanilla extract) then i’ll have it down.reply lauren allen saysapril 10, 2018 at 12:40 pmthe third time should be the charm! thanks for sharing 🙂replyleave a reply cancel replyyour email address will not be published. required fields are marked *commentname * email * website
