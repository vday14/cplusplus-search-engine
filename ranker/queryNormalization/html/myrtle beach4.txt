gina trimarco, founder of carolina improv
“because myrtle beach is not a huge metropolitan market, i could be a big fish in a small pond," gina says."i would have never done this in chicago, where i moved from, for several reasons. the biggest is that there is too much competition for this art form there; improv studios are everywhere. here, it is a unique concept, and people are hungry for unique businesses. also, because of the area’s size, networking is very effective, and there are so many opportunities to do it.”
