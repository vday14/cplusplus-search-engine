ann arbor -- since there's no spring game on saturday, you need something to read, right?
michigan is moving right along with its spring football schedule. the wolverines are 10 practices down with five to go, including saturday's now-closed scrimmage for families and recruits on visits.
after that, the team will take an eight-hour plane ride over the atlantic ocean for a week-long trip to france.but before we hit the final stretch of spring, you have plenty of questions. there are plenty of new faces, position battles and things lingering. so let's get to it.
of course, if you have a michigan football question you'd like to have considered for the next mailbag, tweet me @aaronmcmann or send me an email with "ask aaron" in the subject line.
q: how will ed warinner's scheme help michigan's offensive line? (@htjones81)
a: well, the jury is still out, henry, but simplification seems like a good start. even last fall camp, michigan's offensive linemen were playing (and learning) three and four positions. when you aren't confident at one, it's not always best to learn multiple. that appears to be where tim drevno and company went wrong with the offensive line in 2017. sure, they were young and inexperienced, but more inroads could have been made had there not been so much shuffling.
warinner went back to basics upon arrival in ann arbor: he watched film, evaluated each lineman for what he did well and assigned him a position. since then, spring practice has been about growing comfortable in those roles and jelling as a unit. time will tell whether it works, but it sounds like the players are more confident in what they're doing. and that's a start.
q: i'm interested to know if there's been any steep competition at the safety spot, where it seemed every decent qb they faced was able to find success. what about the replacement for mike mccray? anyone emerge there as a leader? (ben p., via email)
a: there is competition, but where it sits remains a mystery. we spoke to cornerbacks coach mike zordich earlier this week, and he indicated tyree kinnel and josh metellus have answered the bell. now, there's still plenty of time between now and the season opener at notre dame, but i'd have to believe they'll get the first look at safety.
behind them, though, is a crapshoot. jaylen kelly-powell is getting plenty of run at safety and nickel. j'marick woods is in there, too. then there's the dilemma over what to do with casey hughes, the defensive back graduate transfer from utah. he played at cornerback last season, but certainly has the ability to help at safety. and it sounds like the coaching staff are targeting him as one.
as for mike mccray, several guys' names have come up: devin gil, josh uche, jordan anthony and drew singleton. i'd expect as many as two or three of those guys to crack the linebacker rotation at some point in 2018, joining devin bush, jr. and viper khaleke hudson.
with ed warinner on board, michigan's o-line aims for a reset
q: any updates on tarik black and grant newsome? i have not heard anything about eddie mcdoom. is he still on the depth chart at wr? (@mday411)
a: we've written about tarik black quite a bit in recent weeks, including earlier today. he says he's healthy. jim harbaugh says he's healthy. michigan did its due diligence in giving him time to recover. my only question, though, is whether he's lost any speed or explosion.grant newsome, however, is another story. he still has not been cleared to practice, despite going through full conditioning with his teammates in the winter. where that leaves him for fall camp is a mystery. but i'd be surprised if we saw newsome playing a significant role in 2018.
q: any updates on the three early enrollees? (@gobluenyg)
a: haven't heard a ton, but jim harbaugh continues to praise the work ethic of quarterback joe milton. still, milton remains at least two -- maybe three -- spots back on the depth chart. myles sims is getting more time at cornerback with lavert hill out due to injury, and could be a candidate to see some playing time on special teams. defensive end taylor upshaw is also practicing, but there's been little chatter about him so far.
q: do you have the schedule for michigan's schedule in france? i'd like to watch a practice or two while there in april. (scott b., via email)
a: michigan has set its spring trip to paris for april 26-may 3, so it's coming up quick. the team will spend an entire week in france, touring the city and taking in its sights, with the plan to spend one day on the beach at normanday. no practice this year -- it's strictly a team-bonding event.
