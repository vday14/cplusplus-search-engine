“before cool whip and instant pudding, this was how a cream pie was made. if you leave out the bananas, you have vanilla cream pie. if you add 1 cup shredded coconut to milk as it's being heated, you have coconut cream pie.”

at the advice of my mom, i decided to make this for my survivor group last night.
it was a hit.
i found it very easy to make.
my only problem was that i didn't make enough.
i thought one pie would be sufficient for 6 people, but as most everyone wanted seconds i should have made two. thanks for sharing lennie.

have baked 9-inch pie shell ready.
in a large saucepan, scald the milk.
in another saucepan, combine the sugar, flour and salt; gradually stir in the scalded milk.
over medium heat, stirring constantly, cook until thickened.
cover and, stirring occasionally, cook for two minutes longer.
in a small bowl, have the 3 egg yolks, slightly beaten, ready; stir a small amount of the hot mixture into beaten yolks; when thoroughly combined, stir yolks into hot mixture.
cook for one minute longer, stirring constantly.
remove from heat and blend in the butter and vanilla.
let sit until lukewarm.
when ready to pour, slice bananas and scatter in pie shell; pour warm mixture over bananas.
if desired, make a meringue (you'll have 3 leftover egg whites) to top the pie, or just let the pie cool until serving.
