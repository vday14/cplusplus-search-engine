myrtle beach
the heart of the grand strand
opportunities for the perfect vacation are endless in myrtle beach, from relaxing on the shore to a variety of shopping, thrilling rides, exciting attractions and sizzling nightlife. a sophisticated cultural scene brings it all together, making myrtle beach a sought after vacation destination for everyone.
now a thriving metropolis, myrtle beach began as a getaway for employees of the lumber industry in conway who would take the train to "new town" on their free weekends. the area continued to grow until its incorporation in 1957. a contest to name the town resulted in "myrtle beach" after the area&apos;s southern wax myrtle shrubs.
today, visitors have nearly unlimited opportunities for entertainment in myrtle beach. for beautiful views of the atlantic ocean, take a leisurely stroll down the myrtle beach oceanfront boardwalk, and for a panoramic view from 200 feet above sea level, enjoy a ride on the new myrtle beach skywheel. riding the waves on a boogie board is just the thing to cool off on a hot afternoon or visit a myrtle beach water park with slides, wave pools and fountains to beat the heat. to get up close and personal with some of the ocean&apos;s most interesting inhabitants, visit myrtle beach&apos;s ripley&apos;s aquarium or see what a 70 mph hurricane wind feels like at wonderworks, the new interactive science museum.get lost in the mirror maze at the hollywood wax museum entertainment center.  and nothing says summer like an afternoon of baseball at ticketreturn.com field, home of the myrtle beach pelicans.
with over 87 premier golf courses to choose from - myrtle beach is a golfer&apos;s paradise!
for those who love to be active, myrtle beach state park and huntington beach state park offer maritime forests and unspoiled beachfront for camping, hiking, biking and even nature programs for all ages. anglers can throw a line off of local fishing piers, and most offer everything from equipment rentals to bait. the more adventurous will want to try myrtle beach jet skiing or parasailing.
art lovers will enjoy a visit to the area&apos;s art museum, located a stone&apos;s throw from the ocean and features world-class exhibits year round. myrtle beach is also host to a well-known symphony whose concerts draw hundreds of music lovers.
myrtle beach night life is another adventure to explore, with comedy clubs, music from country to disco, and dancing to every beat. exciting dinner shows featuring pirates and medieval knights are destined to be the night the entire family will never forget.
