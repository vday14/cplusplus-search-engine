'black panther'
in the holdover news for friday, blockers fell somewhat harshly on its second friday, ironically taking a hit from universal/comcast corp's's own truth or dare among the teen girl/young women demographic. the terrific kay cannon-directed comedy earned $3.241 million (-58%) on friday, setting the stage for a $10m (-51%) second weekend and $36.7m ten-day total. that's not bad for a $20m comedy, but i was hoping the movie would be leggier. blame truth or dare and blame paramount/viacom inc.'s a quiet place sucking all of the oxygen out of the room. this one will hopefully still stick around for the next month, because it's a real gem.
in related news, warner bros./time warner inc.'s ready player one took a hit thanks to warner bros./time warner inc.'s rampage. to be fair, this cannibalization was created only after walt disney moved avengers: infinity war up a week, sending rampage from april 20 to this weekend. but the damage was done, as rampage is merely opening "okay" and ready player one earned just $2.93 million (-57%) on its second friday. that positions the steven spielberg flick for a $10.3m (-58%) third weekend, bringing the $175m-budgeted film (which has crossed $400m worldwide) to around $114m in 17 days.
fox searchlight expanded isle of dogs into 1,939 theaters in its fourth weekend of release. the wes anderson-directed animated fable about dogs cast into exile in a future japan earned $1.555 million (+8.5% despite adding 1,500 screens) on friday for a likely $4.8m (+7%) weekend and $18.3m 24-day cume. even if it has peaked this weekend, a $25m-$30m total would be quite solid for a movie like this, especially as much of the media attention has been (understandably) about cultural appropriation and white savior tropes. come what may, this is another notch in fox searchlight's belt as they fight to justify themselves should the fox/disney deal go through next summer.
walt disney's black panther earned another $1.447 million (-39%) on its ninth friday, giving it a new total of $699.9m. so it'll pass $670m domestic by the end of this sentence, with a likely $5.4m (-38%) weekend giving the mcu flick a $673m domestic cume after two months in theaters. it still looks like this one will end its run with $685-$690m. we'll find out tomorrow if it has enough left in the tank overseas to make it past the $1.33 billion global gross of star wars: the last jedi. walt disney will have the year's biggest hit (thus far) and arguably the year's biggest flop (thus far) in a wrinkle in time ($117m worldwide on a $103m budget). but that's a conversation for another day.
roadside attractions and lionsgate's i can only imagine earned another $1.09 million (-49%) on its fifth friday. that should position the christian rock biopic for a $3.89m (-50%) weekend and dynamite $75m 31-day total. it's starting to fall a bit, so getting to heaven is for real's $91m (in 2014) domestic total may now be a slight challenge. tyler perry's acrimony will earn around $3.6m (-56%) in its third weekend for a $37.8m 17-day total.  and chappaquiddick will earn around $2.85m (-51%) in its second weekend to give the entertainment studios ted kennedy drama a $10.83m ten-day cume.
